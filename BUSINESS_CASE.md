# Nexus - Business Case & Executive Summary

## Executive Summary
THE 2050 net-zero target has made sustainability an operational and financial necessity for the electricity and heat generation sector. There are demands for transparency in emissions and sustainability reporting. Current manual and fragmented compliance processes fail to meet the demands of new regulations and investors.

Our solution, **Nexus**, is a holistic tool for sustainability reporting, a platform designed for electricity and heat generation companies. Nexus enables utilities, and energy providers to remain compliant and gain competitive advantage in the energy market. It is not just a reporting tool, it is a profitability and risk reducing platform.

## 1. Why will they buy it

### Pain points
- **Financial and regulatory risks**: Fines and sanctions for non-compliance with regulatory standards
- **Investor pressure and capital constraints**: Ability or inability to secure financing due to non standardised data
- **Operational blind spots**: Siloed, manual and segmented reporting that fail to provide real time reporting
- **Reporting overload**: Excess time, labour and high risk of errors in co-ordinating separate data sources

### What Nexus offers
- **Access to capital**: Provides data to help users meet the requirements of sustainability financing. This lowers their costs.
- **Enhances brand trust and license to operate**: Transparent reporting builds public trust and trust from regulators- This secures their long term license to operate.
- **Compliance and strategy**: Nexus reduces time spent on data collection, frees up time for the team to focus on decarbonization planning.

### Why is Nexus different
Existing tools are often single data aggregators or general purpose spreadsheets. Others are very complex tools with a lot of information detracting from what really matters. Nexus gives real time data visuals that help in decision making and clarity.

## 2. Where will we sell it

### Primary Customers
- Independent power producers
