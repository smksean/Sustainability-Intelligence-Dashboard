# Metrics Reference (Plain Language)

This document explains each metric in the prototype, how it’s calculated, and how to read it.

## 1) CO₂ intensity (g/kWh)
- What: Carbon emitted per unit electricity generated.
- Unit: grams of CO₂ per kWh (g/kWh)
- Calculation (simulated): Derived from the generation mix (higher renewables → lower intensity), with realistic variability (weather, outages).
- How to read: Lower is better. Spikes often indicate lower renewable availability or outages.

## 2) Generation mix (MW)
- What: Electricity generated by source (hydro, wind, solar, nuclear, fossil) over time.
- Unit: megawatts (MW)
- Calculation: Simulated supply by technology, scaled to demand with diurnal/weather factors.
- How to read: The stacked area height ≈ total output. Larger renewable area → typically lower CO₂ intensity.

## 3) Renewable share (%)
- What: Percentage of total generation from renewables (hydro + wind + solar).
- Unit: percent (%)
- Formula: `renewable_share_pct = 100 × (hydro_mw + wind_mw + solar_mw) / total_mw`
- How to read: Higher is generally good; expect CO₂ intensity to fall as share rises.

## 4) Net‑zero alignment (%) (annual)
- What: Annual progress vs a target emissions pathway.
- Unit: percent (%)
- Formula: `alignment_pct = 100 × target_emissions_mt / actual_emissions_mt` (capped at 100%)
- How to read: 100% = on or ahead of plan; <100% = behind plan.

## 5) Real‑time Alignment Index (RAI)
- What: How current carbon intensity compares to this year’s target intensity.
- Unit: percent (%)
- Formula: `RAI = 100 × I_target(year) / I_current`
  - `I_current` from the latest CO₂ intensity reading.
  - `I_target(year)` inferred from annual targets (proportional scaling from base year intensity).
- How to read: 100% = on target; >100% better than target; <100% behind.

## 6) YTD Carbon Budget (tons) and days ahead/behind
- What: Whether cumulative emissions so far are within the year‑to‑date (YTD) budget.
- Units: tons (t) and days
- Emissions per interval: `tons_t = total_mw × Δt_hours × intensity_g_per_kWh × 1e−3`
- Cumulative year‑to‑date: `YTD_tons = Σ tons_t`
- YTD budget: `YTD_budget_tons = annual_target_tons × (elapsed_days / 365)`
- Days ahead/behind: `(YTD_budget_tons − YTD_tons) / avg_daily_emissions`
- How to read: Positive days → ahead (good); negative → behind (bad).

## 7) Decarbonization velocity vs required
- What: Is intensity falling fast enough to meet the year‑end target?
- Unit: g/kWh per year
- Actual velocity: slope of intensity decline over the last ~7 days (regression), converted to g/kWh/yr.
- Required velocity: `(I_current − I_target_year_end) × 365 / days_left`
- On track: `v_actual ≥ v_required`
- How to read: “On track” if current decline rate is sufficient; otherwise “Behind”.

## 8) 2050 Pathway Alignment and ETA
- What: Relation to the net‑zero pathway and an illustrative ETA to near‑zero.
- Alignment (annual): `100 × target_emissions_mt / actual_emissions_mt` (capped at 100%).
- ETA: If current intensity drops at `v_actual`, `ETA_year ≈ current_year + I_current / v_actual` (illustrative).
- Pathway sparkline: target emissions per year to 2050 (with 2050 = 0 Mt).
- How to read: Higher alignment is better; ETA closer to/before 2050 is better.

## Assumptions and Notes
- Base year: earliest year present in the data (or in `netzero_alignment`).
- Targets: read from `netzero_alignment`; 2050 target is set to 0 Mt for the pathway.
- Simulation: uses diurnal demand, weather variation, and occasional outages/price shocks to mimic real behavior.
- Proportional intensity target: where direct intensity targets are absent, intensity target is scaled from base year using annual emissions targets.
- Illustrative ETA: for guidance only—production should use validated pathways/scenarios (e.g., IEA NZE) and robust demand forecasts.
