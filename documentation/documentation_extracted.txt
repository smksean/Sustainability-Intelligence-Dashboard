Sustainability Intelligence Platform – 
Documentation (for Development & 
Simulation) 

1. Project Context 

●  Event: JunctionX Vaasa 2025 – Hack the Future of Energy & Tech 

●  Challenge Partner: Wärtsilä 

●  Theme: Sustainability Intelligence Platform 

●  Objective: Build a prototype tool that simulates real-time power sector metrics, hosted 

on Supabase, with a dashboard for sustainability intelligence. 

2. Problem Statement 

The power sector produces ~36% of global CO₂ emissions. Current reporting is fragmented and 
retrospective. 
 Our solution: A real-time simulation of key sustainability KPIs stored in Supabase and 
visualized in a dashboard, helping companies measure progress toward net zero 2050 and 
comply with reporting standards. 

3. Core KPIs (Chosen for Simulation) 

1.  CO₂ Intensity of Electricity (gCO₂/kWh) 

○  Formula: Emissions ÷ Total Electricity Generated. 

○  Simulated range: 100–300 gCO₂/kWh (depending on renewables share). 

2.  Renewable Share of Generation (%) 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
○  Formula: (Renewable Generation ÷ Total Generation) × 100. 

○  Renewables include hydro, wind, solar. 

○  Simulated range: 30–60%. 

3.  Net Zero Trajectory Alignment (%) 

○  Formula: (Reduction achieved ÷ Required reduction path to 2050) × 100. 

○  Requires historical baseline (2020 = 30 Mt CO₂) and yearly target path. 

○  Simulated as a percentage showing if we are ahead / on track / behind. 

4. Database Schema (Supabase) 

We will simulate and store the KPI data in Supabase.

5. Architecture 

●  Supabase: stores simulated data tables. 

●  Backend: Python Flask / Node.js → fetch data from Supabase and serve via API 

endpoints. 

●  Frontend: React + Chart.js/Plotly → fetch from backend and render dashboard. 

6. Dashboard Features 

●  KPI Cards: show current CO₂ Intensity, Renewable Share, Alignment % in real time. 

●  Time Series Graphs: trends of emissions and renewable share. 

●  Trajectory Chart: actual vs target emissions (net zero path). 

●  Simulation Updates: script inserts new rows into Supabase every few minutes to mimic 

real-time feed. 

7. Team Roles 

●  Data Scientist (you): build simulation logic for KPIs, insert into Supabase. 

●  Web Developer: connect frontend to Supabase API, design dashboard. 

●  Business/Finance Student: prepare business case, market potential, compliance 

value. 

8. Development Roadmap 

●  Step 1: Define schema in Supabase (done ✅). 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
●  Step 2: Write Python script to simulate & insert data periodically. 

●  Step 3: Build backend endpoints to query Supabase. 

●  Step 4: Build frontend dashboard (React) to show KPIs & charts. 

●  Step 5: Integrate and polish for demo. 

9. Deliverables 

●  Working dashboard with live simulated data. 

●  Documentation of KPI logic. 

●  Business presentation linking solution to net zero goals.
